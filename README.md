**vanillaform** is a form generator that supports nested fields, components and object branches without complex dependencies.

Feel free to make comments, suggestions and report issues.

**vanillaform** is only a front-end form generator and its development is mainly focused on the *vanillaform.js* and *vanillaform.css* files. However, you will find examples of backend usage in this project. These examples do not contain any code to process the sent data securely. This part is your responsibility.
